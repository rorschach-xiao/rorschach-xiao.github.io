Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is **Yang Xiao** (Chinese: 肖阳) and I'm currently a Master candidate of Computer Science at **Northeastern University** (Vancouver, Canada). Before that, I earned my B.E. degree(2019) from **Beihang University** (Beijing, China), supervised by Prof. [Junchen Wang](https://mrs.buaa.edu.cn/?page_id=18). I used to intern at DiDi/4paradigm/Haier Uhome and work as a full-time CV research engineer at ZMO.AI(an AIGC startup company).

My research interests mainly focus on 2D computer vision, including but not limited to image classification/detection/segmentation, semi-supervised learning, contrastive learning, human image generation, diffsuion model, etc.
